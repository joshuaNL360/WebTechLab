    The Environment is the one thing we all have in common. It is everything that we see around us.
	It gives us all the things needed for our survival - the air we breathe, the food we eat, the water we drink. 
	Plants and animals around us also make up our nature.

<h1 class = headfont> BAGUIO CITY TODAY </h1>
<p class="info" align=left> Baguio City today has become more modernized than before. Slowly, it has been keeping up with the changes over the century. In the recent years, Baguio City's signature image as the "Summer Capital of the Philippines" is slowly becoming a thing in the past now because of the rising temperature which made it not-so cool and refreshing anymore. </p>
<p class="info" align=left> One common cause of this is POLLUTION. With the tourists that comes to visit, together with the other irresponsible residents of the city, Baguio City has been polluted through the air, water and eveon on land. Many people are now, moving into the city and one of their choices is here in Baguio. With the increase of people, there was a need to build more homes to accommodate them. </p>
<p class="info" align=left>If these types of pollution continues, the city will slowly lose it's title and also the residents will also suffer the consequences. There might be a rise in the percentage of unhealthy residents. The local government is taking actions by implementing different policies and orders to help preserve our environment. We hope that as good citizens of the country, we follow these policies and be a role model to the youth. </p>
